# Marval Machete

This is a pet project I've been thinking about doing for awhile now. Then Avengers: Infinity War came out and I couldn't remember where the infinity stones had been and what happened in what movie.

Beyond that, I wanted to build a relatively simple app in React to learn more about it, specifically Linking, Routing, and to expand my knowledge of CSS and UX/UI Design. With 22 movies to cover, I plan on making each one better than the last. 

## Tech used
React
CSS
dotenv
API
