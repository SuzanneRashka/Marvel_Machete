                                    Movie opens finding Captain America buried in ice, which by the end of the movie, explains how he got there. Steve Rogers enters the military and is selected for special program to enhance soldiers. The doctor who turned him into his bigger self, Dr. Erskine, dies to which Rogers gives chase and finds out about HYDRA. After he is sent overseas as propaganda, he learns of Buckys captured unit and goes in after him. Rogers saves the unit but Red Skull gets away. Figures, right? Back home, everyone comes together and devises a new plan. The new team sets out in the frigid mountains where Bucky doesn't make it. With newly filled revenge, Cap goes after Red Skull in a runway/tunnel that would make the Fast and Furious crew jealous. In the final scenes, Red Scull is holding the tesseract which destroys him as we find out later and Rogers has no choice but to bury the payload and himself in the ice.
